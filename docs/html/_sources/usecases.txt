Use Cases
==============

Player acknowledges a neighbor
------------------------------

When the player approaches the neighbor and triggers the dialog of the neighbor, the player will have to acknowledge the neighbor to progress with the dialog. This will trigger the interactable elmement, on enter if pressed signal. the signal will be processed by the character to pass its information to the game manager to pass to the dialog system to progress the dialog. 

Player ignores a neighbor
-------------------------

When the neighbor speaks as the player approaches, the player may choose to ignore them. In that case, the dialog prompt will remain until the player exits the neighbors region. This would be an interactive element, on exit signal. The signal will tell the dialog system to close the speech bubble. 

Player enters dialog
--------------------

Player loses movement control. The dialog manager navigates through the dialog. 

Player extis dialog (mini game)
-------------------------------

The game manager recieving the exit dialog signal will take the exit status from the dialog system and start the mini game for the currently engaged character. This will call the mini game interface Start Game, passing in the difficulty settings. 

Player extis dialog ( no mini game)
-----------------------------------

The game manager will return player movement control.
