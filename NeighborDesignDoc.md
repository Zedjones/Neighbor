## Overview
#### Theme/Setting/Genre
Neighbor is a narrative driven game that uses minigames as an additional means to exhibit the story. It takes place in a uniquely shaped 
apartment complex. Each floor has a different color scheme to add some variety to the world. You play as (We need a name for the 
character) who has come back from work at around 6:00 PM. 
#### Core Gameplay Mechanics Brief
Neighbor uses many different mechanics to show different parts of the story. These mechanics all show up in a variety of ways, including 
being in the many minigames that Neighbor will have the player interacting with. 

A main aspect of the game that will the player will experience is the changing grayscale levels. When the player starts the game, 
(main character) will be seen in vivid colours, while the rest of the world will completely grayscaled. As the game progresses,
and the player interacts with players, the amount of grayscale that is visible will decrease or increase depending on how positively 
(main character) interacts with the NPCs. While (main character) affects the world around him through his actions, (main character) will
lose/gain grayscale depending on how much of his time he gives his Neighbors. This represents him giving part of himself to the NPCs.
