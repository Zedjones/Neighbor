## Overview
#### Theme/Setting/Genre
Neighbor is a narrative driven game that uses minigames as an additional means to exhibit the story. It takes place in a uniquely shaped 
apartment complex. Each floor has a different color scheme to add some variety to the world. You play as (We need a name for the 
character) who has come back from work at around 6:00 PM. 
#### Core Gameplay Mechanics Brief
Neighbor uses many different mechanics to show different parts of the story. These mechanics all show up in a variety of ways, including 
being in the many minigames that Neighbor will have the player interacting with. 

A main aspect of the game that will the player will experience is the changing grayscale levels. When the player starts the game, 
(main character) will be seen in vivid colours, while the rest of the world will completely grayscaled. As the game progresses,
and the player interacts with players, the amount of grayscale that is visible will decrease or increase depending on how positively 
(main character) interacts with the NPCs. While (main character) affects the world around him through his actions, (main character) will
lose/gain grayscale depending on how much of his time he gives his Neighbors. This represents him giving part of himself to the NPCs.

Each game shares a common happiness meter(spelling??) that calculates how "happy" you made the NPC, this is determined in two ways. How well you did at the minigame itself, if you played the minigame, as well as what dialogue options you chose. For dialogue choices, there is a general format that has four options. 

##### Targeted platforms
Our target for this game is PC first, and a later port to mobile. This changes how we develop the game, as we cannot complicate the controls too much and we have to keep in mind touch controls for all the minigames and overworld movement.

##### Monetization model (Brief/Document) 
We plan on selling the game for X dollars, we need to decide this value. 

### Influences (Brief)
##### Night in the Woods
<Heavy?> (Game)
Night in the Woods was a very important inspiration for this game. The idea that the game would be based around these minigames that helped develop the plot/story of the game is very important to this game. Night in the Woods has minigames that help you understand what Mae Borowski is experiencing through the game. Everything is completely new to Mae, and that's what makes each minigame interesting, the fact that you are thrown into each minigame with absolutely no tutorial is something that influenced me as to how gameplay expresses parts of the story. The other thing that Night in the Woods does well is have a narrative story that is very relatable and means something to the player. While all games have things in their stories that you can draw from, such as that the reality of war is very ugly and your decisions can affect more than just yourself in Spec Ops: The Line, I believe that Night in the Woods shows so much more. The game delves into mental illness, loneliness, and many other REAL emotions in a very interesting way. This is what we want from our game, we want the players to feel something from playing our game. We want to make them cry, and realize that helping each other and being kind in a much deeper way makes the world brighter, but to also remember to take care of yourself. 
##### Stardew Valley
<Medium> (Game)
Stardew Valley influenced me in how the minigames would appear in the game. Stardew Valley's minigames don't always require you to enter an instance of the game. They are built sometimes right into the overworld, such as the "minigame" for the mines, where you simply enter a mine and fight monsters by going deeper into the cave. There is no loading screen, you seemlessly go from being a farmer/villager person, to someone fighting off monsters. While our minigames aren't necessarily going to be as seemless as Stardew Valley there is still some influence taken from the game in that sense. I hope to have our game's minigames be somewhat seemless. The player should not feel like they are entering a completely different area, rather, taking the view of (main character) and playing through his eyes.
	
### Gameplay
The dialogue options that the player will face will have a general format as to how they affect the NPC and player. One option is to disregard any request to help them, which will of course not help them in any way, and may actually reduce their happiness. The other options will help to different extents. For instance, the next amount of help you could provide would be a constant, where you don't play the minigame but give the NPC some valuable advice. The other two would be if you simply did the task (minigame) for the NPC, which would give points based on how well you did at the minigame, without any modifier, while the last dialogue would initiate the minigame and give you a higher modifier, where you will have given them more "happiness" than any other option. The options that give less happiness will of course drain (main character)'s energy & happiness less, as they require less effort from the player and (main character), while the greater the effort that they put into the dialogue and minigame, the more energy and happiness that will be drained from (main character) but the more happiness will be given to the NPC. This means that the player must sometimes pick and choose where he puts his/her energy.
